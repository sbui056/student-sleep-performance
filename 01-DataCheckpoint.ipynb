    "This project will use data representing sleep quality with insomnia serving as the primary metric, and this data will come in the form of self-reported questionnaires from students in which they rate the severity of their insomnia. For data representing academic performance, we can use self-reported data on academic performance including metrics such as assignment completion, focus, and motivation. "

    "Sleep is a periodically recurring state of rest that occurs in the human body every 24 hours and lasts for several hours. It is naturally induced by the brain and is characterized by reduced activity and decreased responsiveness to stimuli. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) The functions of sleep with respect to the brain are numerous, including clearing out accumulated toxins and waste products, consolidating information acquired during daytime, and repairing neurons damaged by free radicals. These processes support the cognitive systems required for effective learning, attention, and decision-making. Because academic performance depends heavily on these same cognitive functions, it is reasonable to expect that sleep quality could predict how well students are able to perform academically. This connection forms the basis of our project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous studies existing on the impact of sleep on cognitive functioning in general. For example, a study by Garcia et al. found that all basic cognitive processes of people were detrimentally affected after 24 hours or more without sleep, including attention, working memory, and executive functions such as cognitive flexibility and inhibition of irrelevant sensory stimuli. However, the researchers also found that these processes were differentially affected by sleep deprivation. Attention related processes were found to be impacted the most, while working memory was impacted moderately and cognitive flexibility, one component of executive functioning, was not found to be impacted at all. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) These researchers were able to quantify the effects of sleep deprivation through cognitive tests given before and after the participants were subjected to the sleep deprivation. This pattern is especially relevant for our research because academic tasks such as focusing in class, completing assignments, and maintaining motivation rely heavily on attention and working memory, the very processes most vulnerable to poor sleep quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrowing down further, a study done by researchers from the University of Washington directly investigated the relationship of sleep with academic performance using multiple parameters including chronotype, sleep variability, and sleep timing differences between weekdays and weekends or whether one is an early bird or a night owl, They found that irregular or low-quality sleep predicted worse academic performance, even when total hours slept were similar across students. This suggests that subjective experiences of sleep quality such as insomnia symptoms, capture meaningful variation in students’ cognitive and academic functioning. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these studies show that sleep is closely tied to the cognitive abilities that support academic performance, especially attention and working memory. When sleep quality declines, these systems become less reliable, making it more difficult for students to stay focused, complete assignments, and maintain motivation. This connection is the reason we use insomnia symptoms as our primary measure of sleep quality, since they capture the kinds of disturbances that directly affect these cognitive processes. Similarly, relying on students’ self-reported academic behaviors aligns with how previous research has approached this question and allows us to examine whether the same relationships appear within our own sample. \n",

    "### Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset #1: Student Insomnia and Educational Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset focuses on understanding the relationship between students’ sleep habits, lifestyle factors, and academic performance. Each row represents an individual survey response, and each column corresponds to a self-reported variable related to sleep behavior, stress, and performance. Although only two sample responses are shown, the full dataset reportedly includes hundreds of participants, providing insight into how insufficient or poor-quality sleep affects students’ academic and cognitive functioning. Since there are two versions of the dataset, we will be sticking with Version 2, which has 996 rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected through an online survey administered via Google Forms in Oct-Nov 2024. Respondents were asked to provide insights into their sleep behaviors and the effects on their academic and daily activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "1. Demographics: Year of study and gender.\n",
    "2. Sleep Patterns: Frequency of difficulty falling asleep, hours of sleep, night awakenings, and overall sleep quality.\n",
    "3. Cognitive and Academic Effects: Impact on concentration, fatigue, class attendance, assignment completion, and overall academic performance.\n",
    "4. Lifestyle Factors: Electronic device usage before sleep, caffeine consumption, and physical activity frequency.\n",
    "5. Stress Levels: Self-reported stress related to academic workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concerns\n",
    "Since all data are self-reported, responses may be influenced by the participants ability to recall information or an effort to make themselves look better. For example, students may overestimate how much sleep or exercise they get, or underreport screen time and caffeine consumption. Moreover, because the survey was optional, students that filled it out were likely more aware or concerned about their sleep habits. This could lead to potential sampling bias. Measures such as “sleep quality”, “stress”, and “academic performance” are also subjective, leading to a lack of standardizationg and comparability of results across individuals. Another limitation lies in the timing and context of data collection. The survey was conducted between October and November 2024, when midterm or final exams often occur. As a result, there would be more academic stress and worse sleep quality during this period, meaning the responses may not accurately represent students’ typical sleep behaviors throughout the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the dataset remains valuable for exploring general trends and relationships between sleep, lifestyle factors, and academic performance, offering meaningful insights into how sleep hygiene affects university students’ well-being and success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset #2: Student Sleep Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The Student Sleep Patterns Dataset contains information on the sleep habits and daily routines of 500 university students. It includes 14 columns describing each student's demographics, lifestyle factors, and sleep-related behavior. The dataset is synthetic, meaning it was generated artificially to simulate realistic patterns rather than collected from real participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was synthetically generated using realistic statistical distributions to reflect common patterns among university students. It was designed to model how different lifestyle factors might influence sleep duration and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "1. Sleep_Duration (hours): Average nightly sleep time.\n",
    "2. Sleep_Quality (1-10): Self-reported quality of sleep.\n",
    "3. Study_Hours (hours/day): Average daily study time.\n",
    "4. Screen_Time (hours/day): Daily non-academic screen exposure.\n",
    "5. Caffeine_Intake (drinks/day): Number of caffeinated beverages consumed.\n",
    "6. Physical_Activity (minutes/day): Time spent on physical exercise.\n",
    "7. Sleep_Times (weekday/weekend): Bedtime and wake-up times in 24-hour format.\n",
    "8. Demographics: Age, gender, and university year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concerns\n",
    "Because the dataset is synthetic, it does not represent real students and may not capture the full complexity of real-world sleep behaviors. The sleep quality variable is subjective and may not align with clinical measures. Additionally, the dataset lacks important factors like stress, diet, or mental health, which could influence sleep patterns. Despite these limitations, it provides a clean, well-structured dataset for learning and practicing data analysis."

    "\n",
    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",

    "\n",
    "The Student Performance & Behavior Dataset contains real academic and behavioral records from 5,000 students enrolled at a private learning provider. It includes 24 columns covering demographics, academic outcomes, study habits, and lifestyle factors. Because the data comes from actual student records (with sensitive fields anonymized), it offers meaningful insights into how various factors relate to academic success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was compiled directly from the institution’s internal academic tracking system. The data reflects real student performance measures, attendance logs, participation scores, and self-reported lifestyle indicators such as study hours, stress levels, and sleep duration. Some fields—like names or emails—may be anonymized to protect student privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Academic Performance:**  \n",
    "   - *Midterm_Score, Final_Score, Assignments_Avg, Quizzes_Avg, Participation_Score, Projects_Score*  \n",
    "   - *Total_Score:* Weighted composite based on official grading policy:  \n",
    "     - Midterm (15%)  \n",
    "     - Final (25%)  \n",
    "     - Assignments (15%)  \n",
    "     - Quizzes (10%)  \n",
    "     - Participation (5%)  \n",
    "     - Projects (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demographics:**  \n",
    "   - *Student_ID, First_Name, Last_Name, Email, Gender, Age, Department*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Behavioral & Lifestyle Factors:**  \n",
    "   - *Attendance (%), Study_Hours_per_Week, Extracurricular_Activities, Internet_Access_at_Home, Stress_Level (1–10), Sleep_Hours_per_Night*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Family Background:**  \n",
    "   - *Parent_Education_Level, Family_Income_Level*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Grade:**  \n",
    "   - Letter grade from A–F based on Total_Score  \n",
    "   - Attendance is not included in the total score or has minimal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this dataset is based on real institutional data, it may contain natural irregularities such as missing values in fields like Attendance, Assignments_Avg, or Parent_Education_Level. Some biases may also be present—for example, students with higher attendance occasionally receiving slightly higher grades. The distribution of students across departments is imbalanced, which may affect model performance or generalizability. Additionally, self-reported variables like stress level or sleep duration may not perfectly reflect actual behavior. Despite these challenges, the dataset is rich, detailed, and highly suitable for academic research, predictive modeling, and exploratory data analysis."

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.1 Informed consent\n",
    "X\n",
    "Because our project involves surveying students, all participants will be informed about what data we are collecting, how it will be used, and that participation is voluntary. They will be able to opt in and may exit the survey at any time. No data will be collected without their explicit agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.2 Collection bias\n",
    "X\n",
    "Our sample may be biased toward students who choose to respond, which could skew results toward individuals who are more motivated or more concerned about their sleep habits. We will acknowledge this limitation and keep the survey questions simple and neutral to reduce self-selection bias as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.3 Limit PII exposure\n",
    "X\n",
    "We will not collect names, emails, student IDs, or any information that could identify a participant. All responses will be anonymous, and no demographic details will be required unless directly relevant to the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A.4 Downstream bias mitigation\n",
    "X\n",
    "Because our analysis is exploratory and anonymous, fairness risks are low. However, we will still check for uneven representation across groups (if available) and note how this may influence our conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.1 Data security\n",
    "X\n",
    "All survey data will be stored securely within our group's folders. Only team members will have access, and the data will not be uploaded to public platforms or shared outside the course context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.2 Right to be forgotten\n",
    "X\n",
    "Since responses will be anonymous, individual participants cannot be directly identified. However, we will give participants the ability to contact us before final analysis if they wish to have their response removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B.3 Data retention plan\n",
    "X\n",
    "We will delete all data after the project is done. The dataset will not be used any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C.1 Missing perspectives: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "X\n",
    "We recognize that our project focuses primarily on student-reported data, which may not fully capture external factors such as instructor expectations, campus culture, or socioeconomic influences on sleep and academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C.2 Dataset bias\n",
    "X\n",
    "There is a risk of omitted confounding variables in the dataset as the data only implies causation through correlation, however the dataset has some level of mitigation strategies in the form of introducing other possible factors to academic performance such as stress from workload and physical activity. We have also thought of the possibility that getting less sleep could be linked to better academic performance for some individuals, as in some cases exceptionally high performing students get less sleep due to the sheer amount of work they subject themselves to, however these cases are anomalies and can be treated as outliers or otherwise be averaged out by the rest of the dataset.\n",
    "C.5 Auditability: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "Yes. Since we are using Git’s version control system, all steps in the process are recorded and accessible. If there are issues, we can check the Git history of our repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### D.1 Proxy discrimination\n",
    "X\n",
    "Yes. The variables for the first dataset are “sleep patterns, quality, fatigue, stress levels, academic performance, and lifestyle habits”. These variables are universal to all human beings, so they don’t pose a risk of being discriminatory."

    "Our team agreed on clear expectations to make sure the project stays organized and that everyone feels respected throughout the process. We will treat each other’s time, ideas, and responsibilities with respect, especially when giving feedback or redistributing tasks. At the beginning of the project, we outlined who is responsible for survey design, analysis, coding, writing, and project coordination, and we will revisit these roles as the project develops.\n",
    "\n",
    "A core expectation for our group is communicating early and often. If someone is confused about their part, needs help, or expects a delay, they are responsible for reaching out to the team as soon as possible. Early communication prevents last-minute stress and helps us support each other when workloads get heavier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For accountability, we will use shared documents and a shared workspace so that everyone can see updates to the code, written sections, and comments. Each team member will look over the full notebook before submission so the final product reflects shared understanding rather than isolated work. By emphasizing respect, consistent communication, and clear division of responsibilities, we aim to maintain a collaborative and balanced workflow throughout the project.\n",
