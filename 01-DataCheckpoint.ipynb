    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
    "5. Feel free to add more cells here if that's helpful for you"

    "### Dataset #1: Student Insomnia and Educational Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset focuses on understanding the relationship between students’ sleep habits, lifestyle factors, and academic performance. Each row represents an individual survey response, and each column corresponds to a self-reported variable related to sleep behavior, stress, and performance. Although only two sample responses are shown, the full dataset reportedly includes hundreds of participants, providing insight into how insufficient or poor-quality sleep affects students’ academic and cognitive functioning. Since there are two versions of the dataset, we will be sticking with Version 2, which has 996 rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected through an online survey administered via Google Forms in Oct-Nov 2024. Respondents were asked to provide insights into their sleep behaviors and the effects on their academic and daily activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features\n",
    "1. Demographics: Year of study and gender.\n",
    "2. Sleep Patterns: Frequency of difficulty falling asleep, hours of sleep, night awakenings, and overall sleep quality.\n",
    "3. Cognitive and Academic Effects: Impact on concentration, fatigue, class attendance, assignment completion, and overall academic performance.\n",
    "4. Lifestyle Factors: Electronic device usage before sleep, caffeine consumption, and physical activity frequency.\n",
    "5. Stress Levels: Self-reported stress related to academic workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concerns\n",
    "Since all data are self-reported, responses may be influenced by the participants ability to recall information or an effort to make themselves look better. For example, students may overestimate how much sleep or exercise they get, or underreport screen time and caffeine consumption. Moreover, because the survey was optional, students that filled it out were likely more aware or concerned about their sleep habits. This could lead to potential sampling bias. Measures such as “sleep quality”, “stress”, and “academic performance” are also subjective, leading to a lack of standardizationg and comparability of results across individuals. Another limitation lies in the timing and context of data collection. The survey was conducted between October and November 2024, when midterm or final exams often occur. As a result, there would be more academic stress and worse sleep quality during this period, meaning the responses may not accurately represent students’ typical sleep behaviors throughout the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the dataset remains valuable for exploring general trends and relationships between sleep, lifestyle factors, and academic performance, offering meaningful insights into how sleep hygiene affects university students’ well-being and success."
