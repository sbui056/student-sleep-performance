    "The ideal dataset would include a variety of variables that capture both sleep quality and relevant demographic information. Key variables would include self-reported sleep quality, possibly supplemented by scientifically measured data such as average sleep duration or sleep consistency, along with demographic details like age, school year, and gender. To ensure meaningful analysis, the dataset should contain a good number of observations, at least 500 students, to provide sufficient statistical power and represent a range of experiences. The data would be collected primarily through self-reported surveys, allowing students to share their sleep habits, lifestyle factors, and academic details. Ideally, this information would be stored in a structured format such as a CSV file, either compiled from new survey responses or sourced from an existing public dataset available online for research use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is hosted on Mendeley Data (URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5mvrx4v62z/3 ). It is freely accessible and does not appear to require special permissions beyond citing the source. The dataset includes variables such as Sleep_Hours, Difficulty_Falling_Asleep, Stress_Level, Academic_Performance, Caffeine_Consumption, and Electronic_Device_Use. These variables are highly relevant because they link sleep behaviors and lifestyle factors to academic outcomes, which aligns strongly with my research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is available on Kaggle (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanjamal002/student-sleep-patterns ). It is also free to access (though a Kaggle account may be needed) and contains variables including Sleep_Duration, Sleep_Quality, Study_Hours, Screen_Time, Caffeine_Intake, and Physical_Activity. These variables are valuable because they allow exploration of how lifestyle behaviors like screen time, caffeine intake and exercise correlate with both sleep metrics and study-related activities, giving a rich dataset for modeling and statistical analysis."

    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
