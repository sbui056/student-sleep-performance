    "To what extent does sleep quality predict academic performance among university students?\n",

    "This project will use data representing sleep quality with insomnia serving as the primary metric, and this data will come in the form of self-reported questionnaires from students in which they rate the severity of their insomnia. For data representing academic performance, we can use self-reported data on academic performance including metrics such as assignment completion, focus, and motivation. "

    "Sleep is a periodically recurring state of rest that occurs in the human body every 24 hours and lasts for several hours. The state of sleep is naturally induced by the brain, and is characterized by a lowering of both its activity and receptivity to stimuli. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) The functions of sleep with respect to the brain are numerous, including the processes of cleaning out accumulated toxins and waste products, consolidating information acquired during daytime, and repairing neurons from damage caused by free radicals. These processes are crucial to maintaining the ability of the brain to function properly, making sleep a strong influencing factor of someone’s behavior in most situations including an academic setting, where cognitive functioning seems to be a relevant factor in academic performance. It follows that sleep quality can work as a metric to predict the academic performance of students, which we plan on testing in our project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous studies existing on the impact of sleep on cognitive functioning in general. For example, a study by Garcia et al. found that all basic cognitive processes of people were detrimentally affected after 24 hours or more without sleep, including attention, working memory, and executive functions such as cognitive flexibility and inhibition of irrelevant sensory stimuli. However, the researchers also found that these processes were differentially affected by sleep deprivation. Attention related processes were found to be impacted the most, while working memory was impacted moderately and cognitive flexibility, one component of executive functioning, was not found to be impacted at all. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) These researchers were able to quantify the effects of sleep deprivation through cognitive tests given before and after the participants were subjected to the sleep deprivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrowing down further, researchers from the University of Washington directly examined the impact of sleep on academic performance in their study “Student’s Sleep and Academic Performance”. This project used multiple parameters to investigate sleep’s impact, including novel ones such as chronotype, or whether one is an early bird or a night owl, differences in sleep timing between school days and the weekend, and more conventional parameters such as “variability of sleep onset, offset, duration, etc”. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, it has been found through research that sleep has a dominant influence on cognition and therefore behavior and its consequences, and therefore seems promising as a predictor of academic performance. We aim to replicate the findings of our fellow sleep researchers with our own project correlating sleep metrics with academic outcomes. \n",

    "The ideal dataset would include a variety of variables that capture both sleep quality and relevant demographic information. Key variables would include self-reported sleep quality, possibly supplemented by scientifically measured data such as average sleep duration or sleep consistency, along with demographic details like age, school year, and gender. To ensure meaningful analysis, the dataset should contain a good number of observations, at least 500 students, to provide sufficient statistical power and represent a range of experiences. The data would be collected primarily through self-reported surveys, allowing students to share their sleep habits, lifestyle factors, and academic details. Ideally, this information would be stored in a structured format such as a CSV file, either compiled from new survey responses or sourced from an existing public dataset available online for research use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset is hosted on Mendeley Data (URL: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5mvrx4v62z/3 ). It is freely accessible and does not appear to require special permissions beyond citing the source. The dataset includes variables such as Sleep_Hours, Difficulty_Falling_Asleep, Stress_Level, Academic_Performance, Caffeine_Consumption, and Electronic_Device_Use. These variables are highly relevant because they link sleep behaviors and lifestyle factors to academic outcomes, which aligns strongly with my research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset is available on Kaggle (URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arsalanjamal002/student-sleep-patterns ). It is also free to access (though a Kaggle account may be needed) and contains variables including Sleep_Duration, Sleep_Quality, Study_Hours, Screen_Time, Caffeine_Intake, and Physical_Activity. These variables are valuable because they allow exploration of how lifestyle behaviors like screen time, caffeine intake and exercise correlate with both sleep metrics and study-related activities, giving a rich dataset for modeling and statistical analysis."
