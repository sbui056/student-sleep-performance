# Sleep Habits and Academic Success

## Why This Matters
Sleep is often assumed to be a major driver of academic success. This project tests whether that assumption holds up when analyzing real student data.

## Research Question
Do students' sleep habits meaningfully predict academic performance?

## Data & Methods
- Self-reported survey data on sleep habits and academic behaviors  
- Large academic performance dataset (~5,000 records)  
- Correlation analysis, regression models, quartile comparisons, and visualizations  

## Key Findings
- Poor sleep is strongly linked to fatigue, concentration problems, and missed classes  
- Sleep variables show weak or inconsistent relationships with grades  
- Sleep duration has little to no correlation with exam or course scores  
- Regression models show minimal predictive power from sleep alone  

## Takeaway
Sleep clearly affects day-to-day functioning, but in our data it was not a reliable predictor of graded academic performance. Academic outcomes appear to depend more on factors like study habits, assessment structure, and coursework design.

## Limitations
- Heavy reliance on self-reported data  
- Noisy and uneven distributions  
- Limited ability to capture long-term effects of sleep  

## Future Work
Future studies should use objective sleep measurements, larger samples, and stronger study designs to better isolate the role of sleep in academic performance.
